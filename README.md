# Exchange\_Bs

A cross-platform Flutter starter app for an exchange-style UI. This repository contains a minimal Flutter project skeleton that targets mobile, web, and desktop platforms and includes a demo **fake login screen** for UI testing and presentation.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This project is provided as a demo / prototype. The included login screen is a *fake/demo* login and there is no production-ready authentication or secure API integration in this repository. Do **not** use this code as-is for handling real user credentials or production funds.

## Features

* Flutter multi-platform scaffold (Android, iOS, Web, Linux, macOS, Windows).
* Demo **fake login** screen for UI/UX testing.
* Simple project structure to be used as a starting point for building an exchange or finance-related app.
* Placeholder assets and sample screens (see `assets/` directory).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev) (recommended stable channel)
* An IDE such as Android Studio, VS Code, or IntelliJ with Flutter plugins
* Platform toolchains for the targets you want (Android SDK, Xcode for macOS/iOS, etc.)

### Clone and run

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/NanoLifeM/Exchange_Bs.git
cd Exchange_Bs

# get dependencies
flutter pub get

# run on the default connected device or emulator
flutter run
```

To run on a specific platform, include the `-d` flag with a device id or use `flutter run -d chrome` for web.

### Build (examples)

```bash
# build for Android
flutter build apk

# build for web
flutter build web

# build for macOS (on macOS host)
flutter build macos
```

## Project Structure (high level)

The `lib/` folder contains the Flutter Dart source. `assets/` holds images and other bundled resources.

## Usage

* This repository is intended as a UI prototype and starting point.
* The fake login is suitable for showcasing navigation, flows, and UI only.
* Replace the fake login and mock data with real authentication and secure API calls before using in production.

### Demo credentials (for local/testing only)

Use any non-empty values on the login screen — the demo login does not authenticate against a real backend.
