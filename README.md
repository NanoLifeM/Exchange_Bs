# Exchange\_Bs

A cross-platform Flutter starter app for an exchange-style UI. This repository contains a minimal Flutter project skeleton that targets mobile, web, and desktop platforms and includes a demo **fake login screen** for UI testing and presentation.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This project is provided as a demo / prototype. The included login screen is a *fake/demo* login and there is no production-ready authentication or secure API integration in this repository. Do **not** use this code as-is for handling real user credentials or production funds.

---

## Features

* Flutter multi-platform scaffold (Android, iOS, Web, Linux, macOS, Windows).
* Demo **fake login** screen for UI/UX testing.
* Clear project separation for data, logic, and presentation layers.
* Placeholder assets and sample screens.

## Screenshots

Below are example screenshots. Images are scaled for preview (no file paths are shown in the prose).

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/readme_files/image1.jpg" alt="Main / Home screen (mockup)" width="420" />
<img src="assets/readme_files/image2.jpg" alt="Login screen (demo / fake login)" width="420" />
<br/>
<img src="assets/readme_files/image3.jpg" alt="Sample list / market view" width="420" />
<img src="assets/readme_files/image4.jpg" alt="Details / trade mockup" width="420" />
<br/>
<img src="assets/readme_files/image5.jpg" alt="Settings / profile mockup" width="420" />
<img src="assets/readme_files/image6.jpg" alt="Example dialog / modal" width="420" />
</div>

*Note:* Images must be committed to the repository for them to render on GitHub.

## Assets

The repository includes the following image files (used above as screenshots):

* `image1.jpg`
* `image2.jpg`
* `image3.jpg`
* `image4.jpg`
* `image5.jpg`
* `image6.jpg`

(Place these files under your `assets` folder and list the assets in `pubspec.yaml`.)

### Notes about `lib/`

* `lib/data/data_source/` — place API client code, HTTP adapters, local storage adapters, and any raw data fetching logic here.
* `lib/data/models/` — data classes and JSON (de)serialization code (e.g., `fromJson` / `toJson`).
* `lib/data/repository/` — repository interfaces and concrete implementations that the app uses to fetch and persist data.
* `lib/logic/provider/` — Provider-based state management classes (ChangeNotifiers, Providers, or Riverpod wrappers if used).
* `lib/presentation/helper/` and `lib/presentation/ui/ui_helper/` — UI helpers, common widgets, theme setup, and small utilities used by screens.

This separation helps keep the codebase maintainable and makes it easier to replace implementations (for example, swap a fake repository with a real API-backed one).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev) (recommended stable channel)
* An IDE such as Android Studio, VS Code, or IntelliJ with Flutter plugins
* Platform toolchains for the targets you want (Android SDK, Xcode for macOS/iOS, etc.)

### Clone and run

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/NanoLifeM/Exchange_Bs.git
cd Exchange_Bs

# get dependencies
flutter pub get

# run on the default connected device or emulator
flutter run
```

To run on a specific platform, include the `-d` flag with a device id or use `flutter run -d chrome` for web.

### Make sure assets are declared in `pubspec.yaml`

Under `flutter:` add the assets folder, for example:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/readme_files/
```

## Usage

* This repository is intended as a UI prototype and starting point.
* The fake login is suitable for showcasing navigation, flows, and UI only.
* Replace the fake login and mock data with real authentication and secure API calls before using in production.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you plan to add features or fix bugs:

1. Create an issue to discuss bigger changes.
2. Make a feature branch from `main`.
3. Open a pull request when your changes are ready.

Please keep commits focused and provide clear PR descriptions.

## Roadmap / Ideas

* Add real exchange API integration (with secure key management).
* Implement proper authentication and token handling.
* Add automated tests and CI for multiple platforms.
* Improve UI polish and accessibility.
